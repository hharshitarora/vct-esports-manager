Hello Claude I am working on a Valorant data science project where I want to be able to extract as much info as possible from a given data set. I will provide you with a sample match data, some mapping data and a python file that can extract match details. But I want you to think as a Valorant Cheif strategist and professional e sports analyst and extract any more data from the match that can be useful and give more perspective on a player and thier capabilities. 

okay so I am goin to give around 1000 events from a game (A game can even have around 50000 events) can you please look at the events and then look at all the possible events and see if they are covered ? Then looking at the sequence of the events can you please come up with a new list of things we can actually extract from the events that will be very usefull to understand a player and their capabilities.
